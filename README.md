# Hi there, I'm [MOCH. RIZKI KURNIAWAN]! üëã


I am a Software Developer with a deep passion for crafting websites and building engaging user interfaces. My expertise spans both front-end and back-end development, allowing me to bridge the gap between user experience and server-side functionality. I strive to deliver seamless, responsive, and visually appealing user experiences by combining innovative design concepts with efficient, clean code.‚≠ê With a strong sense of discipline and responsibility, I excel in analyzing user needs, designing tailored UI/UX solutions, and creating interactive prototypes. I am committed to translating these designs into responsive, intuitive code that brings ideas to life. My hands-on experience with back-end implementations, API creation, and responsive web development has further strengthened my ability to deliver full-stack solutions. Looking forward to connecting with you! ‚ù§Ô∏è
